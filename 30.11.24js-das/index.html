      <i>JavaScript is a high-level programming language</i> that follows the
      ECMAScript standard. It was originally designed as a scripting language
      for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming
      language, and is currently the most popular programming language in
      use.[1] <u>JavaScript</u> is usually found running in a web browser as
      interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live
      clocks to large web applications.

      is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like
      Node.js,[2] or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base
      programming language lacks the high-level functionality that
      <b>JavaScript</b> offers.
